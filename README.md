Rimworld Tentacle Mod

Requires:

RJW

RJW Genes

Biotech

Anomaly

Ideology

EBSG Framework

Vanilla Expanded Framework



Use the starting scenario if you want to jump right into tentacle stuff. This is my first mod, I'll try to fix shit if it's got problems.

If you don't like purple (or sticking tentacles in your butt) then maybe this mod isn't for you.

Tentacle preg stuff doesn't really work on male pawns. Sorry. Maybe the sounding will come 1 day idk.

Make sure rjw preg setting Implant filter is off. Otherwise you'll just get bug eggs instead of tentacle eggs.
